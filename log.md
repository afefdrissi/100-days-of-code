# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: October 12, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
- Completed 10 items in javascript basics from "Accessing Object Properties with Bracket Notation" to "Accessing Nested Arrays".
- Made my first clone, commit and push through git Bash.
- Created simple slider using jquery(definitely needs enhancement).
### Day 2: October 13, 2018
**Today's Progress**:
- Completed 11 items in javascript basics.

**Thoughts**:
5 more items to complete javascript basics, spent much time on "Profile Lookup", not comfortable with using Json yet. i'm not satisfied with today's progress.
